# Sortable
If you are on Ubuntu please clone this directory and run run.sh.

    ./run.sh

Else ensure Python 2.7 or Python 3.x are installed, remove output.txt (if it exists) and finally run:

    python3 sort.py

This Project has been built with all default python packages and should not require any additional installations beyond either python3 or python2.7 and then contacts the validator to return the project status.
